	<h2>Wenger-What Ramsey brings to the team</h2>
     <p>He is a player who is box-to-box so overall he pushes the team forward," the boss said. "That is what we want in our side. He can play in holding midfield, he can play if needed on the flanks as well. That’s where he is not happy but he can play there as well.
	</p>
	<h2>It’s an honour to pull on the shirt</h2>
	<p>There is no one prouder to play for Arsenal than Carl Jenkinson.
Having grown up as a fan of the club from an early age, he was once a Junior Gunner before making the dream move to Emirates Stadium in 2011.After two loan spells at West Ham and then a serious knee injury, pulling on the shirt against Reading for the first time in 898 days was an emotional moment for the right back.
"Arsenal is my club," Jenkinson said. "I went out on loan for a couple of years but I always thought I wanted to perform so I can come back here, I wanted to be good enough and I still want to be good enough to play here.
"I guess I was proving that I can play at this level, or trying to, while I was out on loan.
"I loved my time at West Ham, I played a lot of football and it was fantastic for me. It's a great club and I enjoyed every minute I had there, but it is great for me to be back here now.
"Arsenal is my club and it is an honour every time I pull on the shirt."</p>
<h2>Team news: Giroud, Ramsey and Nacho</h2>
<p>Arsène Wenger has revealed the latest team news ahead of Saturday's Premier League clash against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light.
He revealed updates on Olivier Giroud, Aaron Ramsey and Nacho Monreal and this is what he had to say:
on the latest team news…
From Tuesday night we’ve lost Lucas for a while with an ankle injury. I think he’ll be out for six to eight weeks. We have Giroud back available and Aaron Ramsey will be in the squad. We are [almost] in November, they have not played so it’s good to have them back. We have a few uncertainties over Walcott, Monreal and Cazorla, but they will all have tests today.
on Giroud and Ramsey…
They are available for selection. I have to be a bit cautious, especially with Aaron Ramsey, because he has not played at all yet. He has only had one week with the team so I will be a bit cautious with him.
on Lucas getting injured just as he was getting more minutes…
Yes it’s very frustrating because he worked very hard to get there. Of course he is absolutely gutted, because it’s an injury coming from nowhere, and a stupid one, because it was a deliberate kick. It’s a similar tackle to [the one from] Xhaka [against Swansea], but there was no red card. But the red card would not have helped Lucas. What is most important is that he’s out for six to eight weeks.
on whether Theo Walcott is ill…
No, he is not ill. There is a slight hamstring alert, a very minor one. He will have a test today.
on whether Theo will be available to face Ludogorets…
He should be OK for Tuesday. If it’s not tomorrow, it’s OK for Tuesday.
on Nacho’s injury…
He has a little muscle tightness.
